This repo includes demos for course "Neural Networks for Machine Learning". This is a great course taught by Geoffrey Hinton.

I am now taking this course and willing to implement some demos.

Course Address:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks

_The Course is free for everyone, and there are not a permanent link for lecture slides, so I think it is legal to share the slides here. If not, someone please remind me._
